Simple static page for Kintsugi. Live in [https://levisporto.com/kintsugi/](https://levisporto.com/kintsugi/)
It was once supposed to be a web store for selling crochet bags, but since the client ended up uninteressed, I refurbished the site into a Kintsugi one.
In this small, silly project, I could practice HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS DOM Manipulation and even learnt about data-i18n, which is very useful to change sites' language.

DISCLAIMER: this site was made licensing a template: 'Anvogue - Multipurpose eCommerce HTML Template', By Avitex.
This was done to 1. speed up development and 2. to force me to practice using another codebase, made by someone I don't know, with little documentation. 
It was a great experience, lots of learning, plus the site looks great. However I will refrain from using templates next time, to practice creating the front-end from scratch.
